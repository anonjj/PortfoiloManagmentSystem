# PortfoiloManagmentSystem
This is a simple java project based on Portfolio Management System idea. 

**1. Problem Statement**
In the modern digital learning landscape, students require a centralized system to
manage their personal growth, track skills, prepare for competitive exams, and
browse useful courses. The absence of such a platform often leads to scattered
efforts and inefficiency. This project aims to solve this by building a Java-based
Portfolio Management System.

**2. Project Description**
The Portfolio Management System is a Java Swing-based desktop application that
enables users to sign up, log in, edit profiles, take mock exams, track their learning
progress, and explore categorized online courses. It features a clean GUI, database
integration with MySQL, and modular DAO classes for separation of logic.

**3. Details of Development**
**i. Methods/Techniques/Algorithm Used**
The system uses the MVC design pattern with DAOs for data access and Swing for
GUI. Event-driven programming is used for user interaction. SQL queries are used to
perform CRUD operations. Leaderboard sorting and profile update mechanisms are
also implemented.
**ii. Tools/Software/Libraries Used**
- Java (Swing)
- MySQL
- JDBC
- IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub (for version control)
**iii. Data/Charts/Datasets Used**
- Udemy course dataset
- Mock question bank for various exams (stored in MySQL)
- Exam date table (application/exam/result dates)
  
**4. Application Advantages and Limitations**
Advantages:
- Centralized student portfolio tracking
- Practice MCQs with leaderboard
- Searchable and filterable course browsing
- User-friendly GUI and modular code
**Limitations:**
- Requires local MySQL setup
- No cloud sync or mobile version
- Limited to structured exam categories and skill inputs
  
**5. Future Scope**
- Deploy as a web app with Spring Boot
- Add resume builder and job board
- Integrate APIs like LinkedIn Learning, Coursera
- Gamify learning tracker
- Support multi-language interface
